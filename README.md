# Kitchen
Where all the cookery happens


The kitchen is an extended analogy based on the metaphor "to put on the backburner," designed to help keep track of projects.

Here is how it works:
The Frontburner -- Projects that are actively being developed
The Backburner -- Projects that have been put on hold for now. Origin of extended analogy.
The Oven -- Projects that may never be completely finished, and are instead periodically updated.
The Cupboard -- Ideas for future projects.
The Table -- Projects that are done and have been released for public use.
